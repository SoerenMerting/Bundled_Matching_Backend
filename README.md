# BundledMatching
Source code for the TUM matching system for allocating tutorial seats

This repository contains an add on to the TUM Matching System for seminars and lab courses. As the original system is not open source, the related code cannot be published here. Hence, the provided code on its own is not ready to run and it still needs to be implemented a small software around (basic database structure, user management, home page etc.). Some additional information you might find in doc.txt.

For running the optimizations, you need gurobi702.
